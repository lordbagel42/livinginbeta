basic structure:

mentors: usually Josie

plans will contain all plans I submit to mentors.

projects will contain all projects as I do them + a finished project.
projects will likely be a weekly blog post style thing, along with an end result writeup.

reflections will be what i do at the end of every flex lab.
similar to project blogging but more reflecting on quality and learning, less of status throughout project.
likely what will be graded by mentors, mostly.
